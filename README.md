Hangout Auto Try Again Chrome Extension
---------------------------------------

An "Auto Try Again?" will appear when the hangout is full. When clicked,
you can try again automatically and it will auto join when there is a free
spot.

The minimum delay is 5 seconds, but you can increase that in options.
This number has been set this so that you wont get banned by Google
and not stress the Google Hangout servers.
